This provides the following new enumerate styles.

 - \greek for lowercase Greek letters
 - \Greek for uppercase Greek letters
 - \Hex for uppercase hexadecimal enumeration
 - \lhex for lowercase hexadecimal enumeration
 - \binenum for binary enumeration
 - \enumnth for "1st", "2nd", "3rd" etc (comes in level and raise flavours)
 - \nthwords for "First", "Second", "Third" etc
 - \nwords for "One", "Two", "Three" etc

Each of these works with enumitem's "starred variant" feature.
So \begin{enumerate}[label=\Hex*] will output a hex enumerated list.
Enumitem provides a start=0 option for starting your enumerations at
0.
A binzero environment is provided for binary starting at zero enumeration.

Also provides two environments nthraise and nthlevel for raised and
level "nth"s.
These are just wrappers for the \engordraisetrue/false switch and the
label=\enumth* thing...

Currently requires amsmath, alphalph, enumitem, binhex, engord, and numname
all of which should be part of any modern TeX distribution.

This isn't so much a package designed for use as a list of recipes for
creating your own new kinds of enumeration.
All of the work is really done by the various packages loaded.

TO DO:

 - Properly namespace the internal macros.
 - Make consistent the way the macros for counters and numbers are
   treated.
 - Replace engord and binhex by fmtcount? (Might not be possible).
 - Add hexzero and Hexzero environments (properly namespaced)
