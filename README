This provides the following new enumerate styles.

 - \greek for lowercase Greek letters
 - \Greek for uppercase Greek letters
 - \enumHex for uppercase hexadecimal enumeration
 - \enumhex for lowercase hexadecimal enumeration
 - \enumbinary for binary enumeration
 - \enumoctal for octal enumeration
 - \raisenth for 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc with raised "th"s
 - \levelnth for 1st, 2nd 3rd with level "th"s
 - \Nthwords for "First", "Second", "Third" etc
 - \nthwords for "first", "second", "third" etc
 - \NTHWORDS for "FIRST", "SECOND", "THIRD" etc
 - \Nwords for "One", "Two", "Three" etc
 - \nwords for "one", "two", "three" etc
 - \NWORDS for "ONE", "TWO", "THREE" etc

Each of these works with enumitem's "starred variant" feature.
So \begin{enumerate}[label=\Hex*] will output a hex enumerated list.
Enumitem provides a start=0 option for starting your enumerations at
0.
A binzero environment is provided for binary starting at zero enumeration.
Likewise enumoctzero, enumHexzero and enumhexzero for the hex enumerations.

Currently requires amsmath, alphalph, enumitem and fmtcount 
all of which should be part of any modern TeX distribution.

This isn't so much a package designed for use as a list of recipes for
creating your own new kinds of enumeration.
All of the work is really done by the various packages loaded.

TWO WARNINGS:

 - You probably don't want to use uppercase greek numbering. Ever.
 - Be careful with uppercase Hex numbering for sections if you also
   have appendices. 
 - (A more general version of the last point) Don't mix \Alph and
   \enumHex, or \alph and \enumhex

TO DO:

 - Properly namespace the internal macros.
 - Make consistent the way the macros for counters and numbers are
   treated.
 - Test spacing of enumerations.
