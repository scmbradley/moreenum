This is the readme for moreenum.sty

This provides the following new enumerate styles.

 - \greek for lowercase Greek letters
 - \Greek for uppercase Greek letters
 - \Hex for uppercase hexadecimal enumeration
 - \lhex for lowercase hexadecimal enumeration
 - \binenum for binary enumeration
 - \enumnth for "1st", "2nd", "3rd" etc
 - \nthwords for "First", "Second", "Third" etc
 - \nwords for "One", "Two", "Three" etc

Each of these works with enumitem's "starred variant" feature.
So \begin{enumerate}[label=\Hex*] will output a hex enumerated list.
Enumitem provides a start=0 option for starting your enumerations at 0.

Currently requires amsmath, alphalph, enumitem, binhex and nth,
all of which should be part of any modern TeX distribution.

Future versions might include numname or fmtcount for more flexible
language-dependent numbers-to-words enumeration.
