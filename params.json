Ever.\r\n - Be careful with uppercase Hex numbering for sections if you also\r\n   have appendices. \r\n - (A more general version of the last point) Don't mix `\\Alph` and\r\n   `\\enumHex`, or `\\alph` and `\\enumhex`\r\n\r\n\r\n## To Do\r\n\r\n - Properly namespace the internal macros.\r\n - Make consistent the way the macros for counters and numbers are\r\n   treated.\r\n - Test spacing of enumerations.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### v1.02\r\n - Spacing issues fixed\r\n - `\\nwords` and friends and `\\nthwords` and friends are now the right way round.\r\n\r\n### v1.01\r\n - `NWORDS` and friends now supported\r\n\r\n### v1.0\r\n - `levelnth` and `raisenth` work with `fmtcount`\r\n - `fmtcount` also replaces `binhex.tex`\r\n - `fmtcount` also replaces `numname`\r\n\r\n### v0.95 \r\n - `levelnth` and `raisenth` work through environments with `engord`'s switch\r\n - `numname` used for `nwords` and `nthwords`\r\n\r\n### v0.9 \r\n - Initial version\r\n\r\n"}
